# File Expity For Nautilus

An extension for Nautilus. Adds file expiration support to the right-click menu, schedule files to be automatically deleted at a later time.

- Uses both the file path and its inode to verify its the correct file for deletion, meaning that renaming/moving/recreating the file will cancel its expiration.
- Scheduling expiry on a directory will also expire everything inside of it ("rm -r" is used).
