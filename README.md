# File Expiry For Nautilus

An extension for Nautilus. Adds file expiration support to the right-click menu, schedule files to be automatically deleted at a later time.

- Uses both the file path and its inode to verify its the correct file for deletion, meaning that renaming/moving/recreating the file will cancel its expiration.
- Moves expired files to the trash
- Expiry can either be scheduled or set to a specific period of no use
- Expiry status can be viewed and cancelled
